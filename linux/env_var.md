There are three types of environment variables:

1. Local - Defined just for the current session. Remote
        or not doesn't matter.
2. User - Env vars present in ```.zshrc``` or ```.zshprofile```.
        ```.zshprofile``` for remote ones
3. System Wide - For all the users. File is ```/etc/zshenv```
4. ```printenv``` prints all the env vars.
